\section{\sc Experience}

{\bf Amazon}, Seattle/Bellevue, Washington USA \newline
{\em Software Development Engineer} \hfill {\bf January 2025 - present} \newline

\begin{list2}
\item Financial compliance driver and feature lead on a cross-team fullstack Java project using Amazon Lambda, SQS, SNS, and GraphQL backend APIs over AppSync served to a JavaScript/HTML front end. Made Amazon's global promotion management and accounting platform SOX-compliant by designing and implementing mandatory finance and accounting approvals.
\item Continued backend Java development work on data flows between customer shipping promotions management and accounting systems at Amazon.
\end{list2}

{\bf Amazon Web Services (AWS)}, Seattle/Bellevue, Washington USA \\
{\em Software Development Engineer Apprentice} \hfill {\bf June 2022 - April 2024} \\
% 06/27/2022 to 04/18/2024
\begin{list2}
%1
\item Developed feature to automate key security tasks within AWS datacenters worldwide. Key performance indicators included efficiency of contract guard force and site security management in protecting server hosts and locating events potentially exposing customer data. Designed and implemented project using Python, GraphQL, and Java and considered localization requirements and governmental edge cases. Drove work across two teams and designed tests and proofs of concept to ensure compliance and efficacy ahead of release.
%2
\item Maintained computer vision and machine learning systems processing petabytes of HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) video frames in real time and training and evaluating model performance against ground truth data. Automated jobs to locate cameras and sites for specific regions.
%3
\item Identified and resolved database query issues in legacy code with new SQL queries to Amazon Redshift databases.
%4
\item Built CloudWatch metrics, dashboards, and alarms to parse logs and monitor automated \\ Distributed Job Scheduler (DJS) jobs and AWS Lambda health and performance.
%5
\item Created and monitored CI/CD pipelines, AWS accounts, and Apollo environments for my team's daily code deployments. Facilitated host patching, permissions management, and code reusability.
