% 1. add link to guitxr
% 2. in first line of guitxr, explain what the project is. in subsequent lines talk about what you individually implemented.
% 3. talk about any unit tests or developer operations management (i.e. managing the git repo for example) that you did
% 4. talk about how it blossomoned into a full fledged research project with the Reality Lab

% huskyMaps
% 1. link to huskymaps?
% 2. be more specific to what geographies the app mapped, what else did it do?
% 3. Don't just say hosted on heroku. Did you do the steps to host it on heroku? needs to be action oriented / show what you did.

% tetris
