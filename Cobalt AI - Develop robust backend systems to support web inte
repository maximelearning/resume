AI:

What draws me to Cobalt AI is your dedication to advancing physical security through AI-driven solutions and the opportunity to contribute to significant technological developments. Your vision of scaling from hundreds of robots to thousands of cameras, all while emphasizing data security and SOC2 compliance, resonates strongly with my experience in backend systems and cloud infrastructure.

At AWS, I developed and optimized backend systems, supporting web interfaces and integrating with various platforms, including video management systems. I have experience managing integration efforts with our Optics platform, where I handled video data from datacenter cameras. Additionally, my work involved deploying updates on airgapped hosts within govcloud environments, which directly aligns with Cobalt's focus on scaling edge devices while maintaining robust security protocols.

I'm particularly excited by the challenge of scaling backend systems 100x, as I've previously contributed to backend code that scaled infrastructure and systems to support expanding operations. My experience also extends to security-focused cloud infrastructure design, including managing least privilege access using AWS Secret Manager and IAM roles. Implementing infrastructure-as-code solutions through AWS CDK has been an integral part of my work, and I look forward to bringing this expertise to Cobalt's AI-enabled edge device deployment.

Furthermore, Cobalt's culture of empathy and focus on work-life balance aligns with my values. I enjoy leading by example in backend development, mentoring teammates, and working in a collaborative environment. I’ve led design reviews and solved interdisciplinary problems, working with applied scientists on challenges in computer vision and machine learning. My passion for innovation, coupled with my backend development expertise in Python, aligns with Cobalt's mission, and I’m eager to help shape the future of security solutions at your company.

Human summary:

At AWS I worked on a team monitoring datacenter footage from hundreds of thousands of cameras around the world and processing petabytes of frames with computer vision ML models.  My role focused on developing and maintaining our infrastructure and hosts, with additional cross-team feature development in datacenter mapping automation. I had the opportunity to work with our distributed video processing system and databases and services running on AWS. Our applied scientists used generative AI to create images of datacenter workers lying in various positions down the aisle and I am eager to apply genAI to suitable problems.

My experience also extends to security-focused cloud infrastructure design, including managing least privilege access using AWS Secret Manager and IAM roles. Implementing infrastructure-as-code solutions through AWS CDK has been an integral part of my work. I am looking forward to learning more about networking and security from my peers in an evolving startup environment. Mentorship and collaborative design review are two of the best parts of the job. We all perform better when we raise each other up.
