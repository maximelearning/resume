\section{\sc Programming Projects}
{\bf malloc}, CSE 351

\vspace{-.3cm}
Implemented memory allocation in C.

{\bf HuskyMaps}, CSE 332

\vspace{-.3cm}
Used Java to implement a local navigation web application. Programmed a rasterization system for rendering tiles when zooming in and out of the HuskyMaps interface, and an A* graph-based text search for locations on the map. Hosted locally and on Heroku.

{\bf Tetris}, CSC 143

\vspace{-.3cm}
Practiced advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) by implementing Tetris in Java. Reinforced understanding of composition, inheritance, and model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. Applied unit testing, version control through Git, and pair programming.

{\bf Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Game Engine}, CSC 143

\vspace{-.3cm}
{\em (Credit to Stanford, Will Crowther)} Used Java to program a text-based RPG engine. Implemented a text file scanner to assign data to generic structures in the game. Developed object-oriented logic to allow players to travel between rooms, interact with objects, and solve puzzles.
